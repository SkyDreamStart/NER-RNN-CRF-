-DOCSTART-  EU rejects German call to boycott British lamb .  Peter Blackburn  BRUSSELS 1996-08-22  The European Commission said on Thursday it disagreed with German advice to consumers to shun British lamb until scientists determine whether mad cow disease can be transmitted to sheep .  Germany 's representative to the European Union 's veterinary committee Werner Zwingmann said on Wednesday consumers should buy sheepmeat from countries other than Britain until the scientific advice was clearer .  " We do n't support any such recommendation because we do n't see any grounds for it , " the Commission 's chief spokesman Nikolaus van der Pas told a news briefing .  He said further scientific study was required and if it was found that action was needed it should be taken by the European Union .  He said a proposal last month by EU Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler to ban sheep brains , spleens and spinal cords from the human and animal food chains was a highly specific and precautionary move to protect human health .  Fischler proposed EU-wide measures after reports from Britain and France that under laboratory conditions sheep could contract Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy ( BSE ) -- mad cow disease .  But Fischler agreed to review his proposal after the EU 's standing veterinary committee , mational animal health officials , questioned if such action was justified as there was only a slight risk to human health .  Spanish Farm Minister Loyola de Palacio had earlier accused Fischler at an EU farm ministers ' meeting of causing unjustified alarm through " dangerous generalisation . "  .  Only France and Britain backed Fischler 's proposal .  The EU 's scientific veterinary and multidisciplinary committees are due to re-examine the issue early next month and make recommendations to the senior veterinary officials .  Sheep have long been known to contract scrapie , a brain-wasting disease similar to BSE which is believed to have been transferred to cattle through feed containing animal waste .  British farmers denied on Thursday there was any danger to human health from their sheep , but expressed concern that German government advice to consumers to avoid British lamb might influence consumers across Europe .  " What we have to be extremely careful of is how other countries are going to take Germany 's lead , " Welsh National Farmers ' Union ( NFU ) chairman John Lloyd Jones said on BBC radio .  Bonn has led efforts to protect public health after consumer confidence collapsed in March after a British report suggested humans could contract an illness similar to mad cow disease by eating contaminated beef .  Germany imported 47,600 sheep from Britain last year , nearly half of total imports .  It brought in 4,275 tonnes of British mutton , some 10 percent of overall imports .  -DOCSTART-  Rare Hendrix song draft sells for almost $ 17,000 .  LONDON 1996-08-22  A rare early handwritten draft of a song by U.S. guitar legend Jimi Hendrix was sold for almost $ 17,000 on Thursday at an auction of some of the late musician 's favourite possessions .  A Florida restaurant paid 10,925 pounds ( $ 16,935 ) for the draft of " Ai n't no telling " , which Hendrix penned on a piece of London hotel stationery in late 1966 .  At the end of a January 1967 concert in the English city of Nottingham he threw the sheet of paper into the audience , where it was retrieved by a fan .  Buyers also snapped up 16 other items that were put up for auction by Hendrix 's former girlfriend Kathy Etchingham , who lived with him from 1966 to 1969 .  They included a black lacquer and mother of pearl inlaid box used by Hendrix to store his drugs , which an anonymous Australian purchaser bought for 5,060 pounds ( $ 7,845 ) .  The guitarist died of a drugs overdose in 1970 aged 27 .  -DOCSTART-  China says Taiwan spoils atmosphere for talks .  BEIJING 1996-08-22  China on Thursday accused Taipei of spoiling the atmosphere for a resumption of talks across the Taiwan Strait with a visit to Ukraine by Taiwanese Vice President Lien Chan this week that infuriated Beijing .  Speaking only hours after Chinese state media said the time was right to engage in political talks with Taiwan , Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang told Reuters : " The necessary atmosphere for the opening of the talks has been disrupted by the Taiwan authorities . "  State media quoted China 's top negotiator with Taipei , Tang Shubei , as telling a visiting group from Taiwan on Wednesday that it was time for the rivals to hold political talks .  " Now is the time for the two sides to engage in political talks ...  that is to end the state of hostility , " Thursday 's overseas edition of the People 's Daily quoted Tang as saying .  The foreign ministry 's Shen told Reuters Television in an interview he had read reports of Tang 's comments but gave no details of why the negotiator had considered the time right for talks with Taiwan , which Beijing considers a renegade province .  China , which has long opposed all Taipei efforts to gain greater international recognition , was infuriated by a visit to Ukraine this week by Taiwanese Vice President Lien .  -DOCSTART-  China says time right for Taiwan talks .

FRANKFURT 1996-08-22  German first-time registrations of motor vehicles jumped 14.2 percent in July this year from the year-earlier period , the Federal office for motor vehicles said on Thursday .  The office said 356,725 new cars were registered in July 1996 -- 304,850 passenger cars and 15,613 trucks .  The figures represent a 13.6 percent increase for passenger cars and a 2.2 percent decline for trucks from July 1995 .  Motor-bike registration rose 32.7 percent in the period .  The growth was partly due to an increased number of Germans buying German cars abroad , while manufacturers said that domestic demand was weak , the federal office said .  Almost all German car manufacturers posted gains in registration numbers in the period .  Volkswagen AG won 77,719 registrations , slightly more than a quarter of the total .  Opel AG together with General Motors came in second place with 49,269 registrations , 16.4 percent of the overall figure .  Third was Ford with 35,563 registrations , or 11.7 percent .

Colleen Siegel  JERUSALEM 1996-08-22  Israel 's outgoing peace negotiator with Syria said on Thursday current tensions between the two countries appeared to be a storm in a teacup .  Itamar Rabinovich , who as Israel 's ambassador to Washington conducted unfruitful negotiations with Syria , told Israel Radio it looked like Damascus wanted to talk rather than fight .  " It appears to me the Syrian priority is still to negotiate .  The Syrians are confused , they are definitely tense , but the general assessment here in Washington is that this is essentially a storm in a teacup , " he said .  Rabinovich is winding up his term as ambassador .  He will be replaced by Eliahu Ben-Elissar , a former Israeli envoy to Egypt and right-wing Likud party politician .  Israel on Wednesday sent Syria a message , via Washington , saying it was committed to peace and wanted to open negotiations without preconditions .  But it slammed Damascus for creating what it called a dangerous atmosphere .  Syria accused Israel on Wednesday of launching a hysterical campaign against it after Israeli television reported that Damascus had recently test fired a missile .  It said its arms purchases were for defensive purposes .  " The message that we sent to ( Syrian President Hafez al- ) Assad is that Israel is ready at any time without preconditions to enter peace negotiations , " Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy told Israel Radio in an interview .  Tension has mounted since Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took office in June vowing to retain the Golan Heights Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war .  Israeli-Syrian peace talks have been deadlocked over the Golan since 1991 despite the previous government 's willingness to make Golan concessions .  Peace talks between the two sides were last held in February .  " The voices coming out of Damascus are bad , not good .  The media ...  are full of expressions and declarations that must be worrying ...  this artificial atmosphere is very dangerous because those who spread it could become its prisoners , " Levy said .  " We expect from Syria , if its face is to peace , that it will answer Israel 's message to enter peace negotiations because that is our goal , " he said . "  We do not want a war , God forbid .  No one benefits from wars . "  Israel 's Channel Two television said Damascus had sent a " calming signal " to Israel .  It gave no source for the report .  Netanyahu and Levy 's spokesmen said they could not confirm it .  The television also said that Netanyahu had sent messages to reassure Syria via Cairo , the United States and Moscow .  -DOCSTART-  Polish diplomat denies nurses stranded in Libya .  TUNIS 1996-08-22  A Polish diplomat on Thursday denied a Polish tabloid report this week that Libya was refusing exit visas to 100 Polish nurses trying to return home after working in the North African country .  " This is not true .  Up to today , we have no knowledge of any nurse stranded or kept in Libya without her will , and we have not received any complaint , " the Polish embassy 's charge d'affaires in Tripoli , Tadeusz Awdankiewicz , told Reuters by telephone .  Poland 's labour ministry said this week it would send a team to Libya to investigate , but Awdankiewicz said the probe was prompted by some nurses complaining about their work conditions such as non-payment of their salaries .  He said that there are an estimated 800 Polish nurses working in Libya .  -DOCSTART-  Two Iranian opposition leaders meet in Baghdad .  Hassan Hafidh  BAGHDAD 1996-08-22  An Iranian exile group based in Iraq vowed on Thursday to extend support to Iran 's Kurdish rebels after they were attacked by Iranian troops deep inside Iraq last month .  A Mujahideen Khalq statement said its leader Massoud Rajavi met in Baghdad the Secretary-General of the Kurdistan Democratic Party of Iran ( KDPI ) Hassan Rastegar on Wednesday and voiced his support to Iran 's rebel Kurds .  " Rajavi emphasised that the Iranian Resistance would continue to stand side by side with their Kurdish compatriots and the resistance movement in Iranian Kurdistan , " it said .  A spokesman for the group said the meeting " signals a new level of cooperation between Mujahideen Khalq and the Iranian Kurdish oppositions " .  Iran heavily bombarded targets in northern Iraq in July in pursuit of KDPI guerrillas based in Iraqi Kurdish areas outside the control of the government in Baghdad .  Iraqi Kurdish areas bordering Iran are under the control of guerrillas of the Iraqi Kurdish Patriotic Union of Kurdistan ( PUK ) group .  PUK and Iraq 's Kurdistan Democratic Party ( KDP ) the two main Iraqi Kurdish factions , have had northern Iraq under their control since Iraqi forces were ousted from Kuwait in the 1991 Gulf War .  Clashes between the two parties broke out at the weekend in the most serious fighting since a U.S.-sponsored ceasefire last year .  Mujahideen Khalq said Iranian troops had also been shelling KDP positions in Qasri region in Suleimaniya province near the Iranian border over the last two days .  It said about 100 Iraqi Kurds were killed or wounded in the attack .  Both Iran and Turkey mount air and land strikes at targets in northern Iraq in pursuit of their own Kurdish rebels .

JERUSALEM 1996-08-22  Israel gave Palestinian President Yasser Arafat permission on Thursday to fly over its territory to the West Bank , ending a brief Israeli-PLO crisis , an Arafat adviser said .  " The problem is over .  The president 's aircraft has received permission to pass through Israeli airspace but the president is not expected to travel to the West Bank before Monday , " Nabil Abu Rdainah told Reuters .  Arafat had been scheduled to meet former Israeli prime minister Shimon Peres in the West Bank town of Ramallah on Thursday but the venue was changed to Gaza after Israel denied flight clearance to the Palestinian leader 's helicopters .  Palestinian officials accused right-wing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of trying to stop the Ramallah meeting by keeping Arafat grounded .  Arafat subsequently cancelled a meeting between Israeli and PLO officials , on civilian affairs , at the Allenby Bridge crossing between Jordan and the West Bank .  Abu Rdainah said Arafat had decided against flying to the West Bank on Thursday , after Israel lifted the ban , because he had a busy schedule in Gaza and would not be free until Monday .  -DOCSTART-  Arafat to meet Peres in Gaza after flight ban .  JERUSALEM 1996-08-22  Yasser Arafat will meet Shimon Peres in Gaza on Thursday after Palestinians said the right-wing Israeli government had barred the Palestinian leader from flying to the West Bank for talks with the former prime minister .  " The meeting between Peres and Arafat will take place at Erez checkpoint in Gaza and not in Ramallah as planned , " Peres ' office said .  Palestinian officials said the Israeli government had barred Arafat from overflying Israel in a Palestinian helicopter to the West Bank in an attempt to bar the meeting with Peres .  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has accused opposition leader Peres , who he defeated in May elections , of trying to undermine his Likud government 's authority to conduct peace talks .  -DOCSTART-  Afghan UAE embassy says Taleban guards going home .  Hilary Gush  DUBAI 1996-08-22  Three Afghan guards brought to the United Arab Emirates last week by Russian hostages who escaped from the Taleban militia will return to Afghanistan in a few days , the Afghan embassy in Abu Dhabi said on Thursday .  " Our ambassador is in touch with the UAE foreign ministry .  Their return to Afghanistan will take place in two or three days , " an embassy official said .  " The embassy is issuing them travel documents for their return to their homeland .  There is no objection to their travel , " he added .  The three Islamic Taleban guards were overpowered by seven Russian aircrew who escaped to UAE state Sharjah last Friday on board their own aircraft after a year in the captivity of Taleban militia in Kandahar in southern Afghanistan .  The UAE said on Monday it would hand over the three to the International Red Crescent , possibly last Tuesday .  It has since been silent on the issue .  When asked whether the three guards would travel back to Kandahar or the Afghan capital Kabul , the embassy official said : " That has not been decided , but possibly Kandahar . "  Kandahar is the headquarters of the opposition Taleban militia .  Kabul is controlled by President Burhanuddin Rabbani 's government , which Taleban is fighting to overthrow .  The embassy official said the three men , believed to be in their 20s , were currently in Abu Dhabi .  He did not elaborate .  The Russians , working for the Aerostan firm in the Russian republic of Tatarstan , were taken hostage after a Taleban MiG-19 fighter forced their cargo plane to land in August 1995 .  Taleban said its shipment of ammunition from Albania was evidence of Russian military support for Rabbani 's government .  Moscow said the crew 's nationality was coincidental .  Numerous diplomatic attempts to free the seven failed .  The Russians , who said they overpowered the guards -- two armed with Kalashnikov automatic rifles -- while doing regular maintenance work on their Ilyushin 76 cargo plane last Friday , left the UAE capital Abu Dhabi for home on Sunday .  -DOCSTART-  Iraq 's Saddam meets Russia 's Zhirinovsky .

BONN 1996-08-22  Germany 's Agriculture Ministry suggested on Wednesday that consumers avoid eating meat from British sheep until scientists determine whether mad cow disease can be transmitted to the animals .  " Until this is cleared up by the European Union 's scientific panels -- and we have asked this to be done as quickly as possible -- ( consumers ) should if at all possible give preference to sheepmeat from other countries , " ministry official Werner Zwingmann told ZDF television .  " I do not want to say that there is a concrete danger for consumers , " he added . "  There are too many holes in what we know , and these must be filled very quickly . "  Bonn has led efforts to ensure consumer protection tops the list of priorities in dealing with the mad cow crisis , which erupted in March when Britain acknowledged humans could contract a similar illness by eating contaminated beef .  The European Commission agreed this month to rethink a proposal to ban the use of suspect sheep tissue after some EU veterinary experts questioned whether it was justified .  EU Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler had proposed banning sheep brains , spleens and spinal cords from the human and animal food chains after reports from Britain and France that under laboratory conditions sheep could contract Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy ( BSE ) -- mad cow disease .  But some members of the EU 's standing veterinary committee questioned whether the action was necessary given the slight risk to human health .  The question is being studied separately by two EU scientific committees .  Sheep have long been known to contract scrapie , a similar brain-wasting disease to BSE which is believed to have been transferred to cattle through feed containing animal waste .  British officials say sheep meat is perfectly safe to eat .  ZDF said Germany imported 47,600 sheep from Britain last year , nearly half of total imports .  It brought in 4,275 tonnes of British mutton , some 10 percent of overall imports .  After the British government admitted a possible link between mad cow disease and its fatal human equivalent , the EU imposed a worldwide ban on British beef exports .  EU leaders agreed at a summit in June to a progressive lifting of the ban as Britain takes parallel measures to eradicate the disease .  -DOCSTART-  GOLF - SCORES AT WORLD SERIES OF GOLF .

Prescott , reluctant to go into the winner 's enclosure until the result of the photo-finish was announced , said : " Twenty-five years and I have never been there so I thought I had better wait a bit longer . "  He added : " It 's very sad to beat Henry Candy because I am godfather to his daughter . "  Like Prescott , Jack Berry , trainer of Mind Games , had gone into Thursday 's race in search of a first group one success after many years around the top of his profession .

SYDNEY 1996-08-22  Australian Davis Cup captain John Newcombe on Thursday signalled his possible resignation if his team loses an away tie against Croatia next month .  The former Wimbledon champion said the immediate future of Australia 's Davis Cup coach Tony Roche could also be determined by events in Split .  " If we lose this one , Tony and I will have to have a good look at giving someone else a go , " Newcombe was quoted as saying in Sydney 's Daily Telegraph newspaper .  Australia face Croatia in the world group qualifying tie on clay from September 20-22 .  Under Newcombe 's leadership , Australia were relegated from the elite world group last year , the first time the 26-time Davis Cup winners had slipped from the top rank .  Since taking over as captain from Neale Fraser in 1994 , Newcombe 's record in tandem with Roche , his former doubles partner , has been three wins and three losses .  Newcombe has selected Wimbledon semifinalist Jason Stoltenberg , Patrick Rafter , Mark Philippoussis , and Olympic doubles champions Todd Woodbridge and Mark Woodforde to face the Croatians .  The home side boasts world number six Goran Ivanisevic , and Newcombe conceded his players would be hard-pressed to beat the Croatian number one .  " We are ready to fight to our last breath -- Australia must play at its absolute best to win , " said Newcombe , who described the tie as the toughest he has faced as captain .  Australia last won the Davis Cup in 1986 , but they were beaten finalists against Germany three years ago under Fraser 's guidance .  -DOCSTART-  BADMINTON - MALAYSIAN OPEN RESULTS .

" It was an off-speed pitch and I just tried to get a good swing on it and put it in play , " Greer said . "  This was a big game .  The crowd was behind him and it was intense . "  The shot brought home Ivan Rodriguez , who had his second double of the game , giving him 42 this season , 41 as a catcher .  He joined Mickey Cochrane , Johnny Bench and Terry Kennedy as the only catchers with 40 doubles in a season .  The Rangers have won 10 of their last 12 games and six of nine meetings against the Indians this season .  The American League Western leaders have won eight of 15 games at Jacobs Field , joining the Yankees as the only teams with a winning record at the A.L. Central leaders ' home .  Cleveland lost for just the second time in six games .  The Indians sent the game into extra innings in the ninth on Kenny Lofton 's two-run single .  Ed Vosberg ( 1-0 ) blew his first save opportunity but got the win , allowing three hits with two walks and three strikeouts in 1 2/3 scoreless innings .  Dean Palmer hit his 30th homer for the Rangers .  In Baltimore , Cal Ripken had four hits and snapped a fifth-inning tie with a solo homer and Bobby Bonilla added a three-run shot in the seventh to power the surging Orioles to a 10-5 victory over the Seattle Mariners .  The Mariners scored four runs in the top of the fifth to tie the game 5-5 but Ripken led off the bottom of the inning with his 21st homer off starter Sterling Hitchcock ( 12-6 ) .  Bonilla 's blast was the first time Randy Johnson , last season 's Cy Young winner , allowed a run in five relief appearances since coming off the disabled list on August 6 .  Bonilla has 21 RBI and 15 runs in his last 20 games .  Baltimore has won seven of nine and 16 of its last 22 and cut the Yankees ' lead in the A.L. East to five games .  Scott Erickson ( 8-10 ) laboured to his third straight win .  Alex Rodriguez had two homers and four RBI for the Mariners , who have dropped three in a row and 11 of 15 .  He became the fifth shortstop in major-league history to hit 30 homers in a season and the first since Ripken hit 34 in 1991 .  Chris Hoiles hit his 22nd homer for Baltimore .  In New York , Jason Dickson scattered 10 hits over 6 1/3 innings in his major-league debut and Chili Davis belted a homer from each side of the plate as the California Angels defeated the Yankees 7-1 .  Dickson allowed a homer to Derek Jeter on his first major-league pitch but settled down .  He was the 27th pitcher used by the Angels this season , tying a major-league record .  Jimmy Key ( 9-10 ) took the loss as the Yankees lost their ninth in 14 games .  They stranded 11 baserunners .  California played without interim manager John McNamara , who was admitted to a New York hospital with a blood clot in his right calf .  In Boston , Mike Stanley 's bases-loaded two-run single snapped an eighth-inning tie and gave the Red Sox their third straight win , 6-4 over the Oakland Athletics .  Stanley owns a .367 career batting average with the bases loaded ( 33-for-90 ) .  Boston 's Mo Vaughn went 3-for-3 with a walk , stole home for one of his three runs scored and collected his 116th RBI .  Scott Brosius homered and drove in two runs for the Athletics , who have lost seven of their last nine games .  In Detroit , Brad Ausmus 's three-run homer capped a four-run eighth and lifted the Tigers to a 7-4 victory over the reeling Chicago White Sox .  The Tigers have won consecutive games after dropping eight in a row , but have won nine of their last 12 at home .  The White Sox have lost six of their last eight games .  In Kansas City , Juan Guzman tossed a complete-game six-hitter to win for the first time in over a month and lower his league-best ERA as the Toronto Blue Jays won their fourth straight , 6-2 over the Royals .  Guzman ( 10-8 ) won for the first time since July 16 , a span of six starts .  He allowed two runs -- one earned -- and lowered his ERA to 2.99 .  At Minnesota , John Jaha 's three-run homer , his 26th , capped a five-run eighth inning that rallied the Milwaukee Brewers to a 10-7 victory over the Twins .

A study by a team of doctors at Oxford University has found people with high blood cholesterol do not benefit significantly from taking garlic tablets .  The study involved 115 people with high blood cholesterol levels .  They were given 900 milligrams a day of dried garlic powder or placebo tablets . "  There were no significant differences between the groups receiving garlic and placebo , " they wrote in the Journal of the Royal College of Physicians .  Those taking part were told to eat a low-fat diet for six weeks before they started taking the pills , and their blood cholesterol measured before and after the six-week period .  The researchers said this would make their findings more accurate .  Several studies have found garlic pills can lower blood pressure and blood cholesterol .  But the Oxford team disputed these findings and said either previous trials may have been interpreted incorrectly , those taking part were not given special diets beforehand or the duration of the studies may have been too short .  The six-month trial was funded by the British Heart Foundation and Lichtwer Pharma GmbH , which makes Kwai brand garlic tablets .

Bill Berkrot  NEW YORK 1996-08-22  World number one Pete Sampras , seeking his first Grand Slam title of the year , and women 's top seed Steffi Graf , aiming for her third , should be able to ease into the year 's final major , which begins on Monday .  Sampras opens the defence of his U.S. Open crown against David Rikl of the Czech Republic , while top-ranked Graf begins her title defence against Yayuk Basuki of Indonesia .  Wednesday 's U.S. Open draw ceremony revealed that both title holders should run into their first serious opposition in the third round .  Looming in Sampras 's future is a likely third-round date with recent nemesis Mark Philippoussis , the rising Australian who took out Sampras in the third round of the Australian Open in January .  Sampras avenged that defeat with a straight sets win over the 19-year-old power hitter in the second round at Wimbledon and their rubber match in New York could provide some first-week fireworks .  While only a stunning upset will keep Graf from sailing through to a predictable semifinal showdown with third seed Arantxa Sanchez Vicario , the German star could also be tested in the third round where she will probably face 28th-ranked veteran Natasha Zvereva of Belarus .  There will be no repeat of last year 's men 's final with eighth-ranked Andre Agassi landing in Sampras 's half of the draw .  Bumping Agassi up to the sixth seeding avoided the possibility that he would run into Sampras as early as the quarter-finals , but they could lock horns in the semis .  Olympic champion Agassi meets Karim Alami of Morocco in the first round .  Surprise second seed Michael Chang , ranked third in the world , opens against Czech Daniel Vacek , while women 's second seed Monica Seles drew American Anne Miller as her first victim .  Second-ranked Austrian Thomas Muster , who was seeded third , did not have the luck of the draw with him .  In the first round Muster faces American Richey Reneberg , who has been playing some of the best tennis of his career of late .  If he survives , Muster is seeded to run into either fifth-seeded Wimbledon champion Richard Krajicek of the Netherlands or 12th-seeded American Todd Martin in the quarter-finals in Chang 's half of the draw .  Perhaps the best , yet most unfortunate , first-round matchup of the men 's competition pits eighth seed Jim Courier against retiring star Stefan Edberg .  The popular Swede is playing his final major tournament next week and the two-time champion 's Grand Slam farewell could well be a one-match affair .  With the exception of a Philippoussis showdown , Sampras looks to have landed in a comfortable quarter of the draw with the likes of Frenchman Cedric Pioline and ailing French Open champion Yevgeny Kafelnikov , who is nursing a rib injury , in his path .  Seles , runner-up to Graf last year , is seeded to run into fifth-ranked German Anke Huber in the quarter-finals with fourth seed Conchita Martinez or eighth-seeded Olympic champion Lindsay Davenport looking like her most likely semifinal opponents .  But Huber will be tested immediately with a first-round encounter against dangerous 18th-ranked South African Amanda Coetzer .  Sanchez Vicario , runner-up to Graf at the French Open and Wimbledon , begins play against a qualifier in a quarter of the draw that includes young talent Martina Hingis , the 16th seed , before a probable quarter-final clash with seventh-seeded veteran Jana Novotna .  Martinez begins play against Ruxandra Dragomir of Romania .  -- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373-1800  -DOCSTART-  RTRS - Tennis - Muster upset , Philippoussis wins , Stoltenberg loses .  TORONTO 1996-08-21  Top-seeded Thomas Muster of Austria was beaten 6-3 7-5 by 123rd-ranked Daniel Nestor of Canada on Wednesday in his first match of the $ 2 million Canadian Open .  A lefthander with a strong serve , Nestor kept the rallies short by constantly attacking the net and the tactic worked in the second-round match against Muster , playing his first match after receiving a first-round bye along with the other top eight seeds .  The tournament also lost its second seed on the third day of play when second-seeded Goran Ivanisevic of Croatia was beaten 6-7(3-7 ) 6-4 6-4 by unseeded Mikael Tillstrom of Sweden .  Other seeded players advancing were number three Wayne Ferreira of South Africa , number four Marcelo Rios of Chile , number six MaliVai Washington of the United States and American Todd Martin , the seventh seeed .  Eighth seed Marc Rosset of Switzerland was eliminated in a one hour , 55 minute battle by unseeded Mark Philippoussis of Australia .  Philippoussis saved a match point at 5-6 in the third-set tie break before winning 6-3 3-6 7-6 ( 8-6 ) .  Philippoussis 's compatriot , 13th seed Jason Stoltenberg , was not as fortunate .  He held one match point at 9-8 in a marathon third-set tie break but was beaten 5-7 7-6 ( 7-1 ) 7-6 ( 13-11 ) by unseeded Daniel Vacek of the Czech Republic .  " I knew I had to serve well and keep the points short and that 's what I was able to do , " said Nestor , who ranks 10th in doubles .  There were only two service breaks in the match .  The lanky Canadian broke Muster at 4-3 in the first set and 5-5 in the second before ending the match on his third match point when the Austrian hit a service return long .  " I probably did n't hit five ground strokes in the whole match , " said Muster , only partly joking . "  The way he was chipping and charging and serving and volleying I did n't really get my timing playing from the baseline . "  " He played a good match , took a few chances , and every time he was down he was able to come up with a big first serve . "  Playing at night was not Muster 's preference . "  I asked for a day match and they gave me a night match , " he said . "  I do n't like playing under the lights but maybe it would not have made any difference . "  Ivanisevic rallied from a 2-5 deficit in the first set but then played erratically against the 44th-ranked Tillstrom , who was a surprise winner over his famous compatriot Stefan Edberg in the second round at Wimbledon .  Ivanisevic hit 32 aces but was outplayed from the back court by the 24-year-old Tillstrom .  The sixth-ranked Ivanisevic , who lost in the final at Indianapolis to world number one Pete Sampras of the U.S. last Sunday , made a quick getaway after his loss but did say : " Something was not there when I arrived ( in Toronto ) .  I did n't feel good .  And I did n't have a good feeling as soon as I lost in my doubles ( on Tuesday ) . "  " I thought he looked a little unfocused at certain times on his ground strokes , " said Tillstrom .  The 19-year-old Philippoussis , who beat Sampras in the third round of this year 's Australian Open , stayed calm in a nervy third-set tie break against Rosset .  " I 'm pleased because I did n't play that great today , but I fought really well , " he said . "  When I was down 2-5 in the tiebreak ( in the third set ) , I just thought about winning my two serves and hoped that he might get tight .  Then he shanked a forehand at to make it 5-all and that helped me back . "  -DOCSTART-  Soccer - Results of South Korean pro-soccer games .

CONAKRY 1996-08-22  The West African state of Guinea declared Thursday and Friday days of national prayer .  A government statement , broadcast repeatedly by state radio , said the two days of prayer were " for the dead , for peace and prosperity in Guinea , the victory of the new government and the health of the head of state " .  The precise reason for the call was not immediately clear .  Guinea 's president , Lansana Conte , vice-president of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference , left for Kuwait on August 16 to prepare the next OIC summit in Pakistan in 1997 .  Koranic reading sessions and prayers were to be held in the farming town of Badi-Tondon , near his home about 60 km ( 40 miles ) from the capital Conakry .  Conte , an army general , survived a February army pay revolt which at the time he described as a veiled attempt to topple him .

NABLUS , West Bank 1996-08-22  A West Bank bookseller charged on Thursday that the Palestinian Information Ministry has forced him to sign an undertaking not to distribute books written by critics of Israeli-PLO self-rule deals .  " They made me sign an undertaking not to sell the books to anyone at the risk of legal action .  One official told me ' you have to either destroy the books or return them to Amman ' , " Daoud Makkawi , owner of the Nablus-based al-Risala bookshop , told Reuters .  He said ministry officials made him sign this a few weeks ago after he brought about a dozen copies from Jordan of a book by Edward Said , a prominent scholar at New York City 's Columbia University .  Said , a U.S. citizen of Palestinian origin , has been an outspoken critic of the 1993 Israeli-PLO self-rule deal and has written at least two books on the accord .  On Wednesday a bookseller in the West Bank town of Ramallah said police about a month ago confiscated several copies of two of Said 's books on the Israel-PLO self-rule deals .  Palestinian Information Ministry Director-General Mutawakel Taha denied that ministry officials forced anyone to sign any undertaking and insisted that the Palestinian Authority has no plans to censor books .  " There is no strategy to ban books or to suppress freedom of expression in any form whatsoever , " Taha told Reuters .  But Taha said that the absence of relevent legislations may have resulted in some mistakes by some security officials .  " This may explain some mistakes against some journalists and writers , " he said .  Daoud said books by other authors , including British Journalist Patrick Seale , were also banned .  He said that security officials often visit his shop to make sure he was not selling the books .  " I think this is a bad beginning .  If we have confidence , why should we be afraid of the other opinion ? "  Daoud said .  Thousands of books were banned from sale in the West Bank and Gaza Strip by the Israeli military authorities before the Jewish state handed over parts of the two areas to the PLO under a self-rule deal in 1994 .  -DOCSTART-  Egypt blames Istanbul control tower for accident .

Hassan al-Turabi is the leader of the National Islamic Front , the political force behind the Sudanese government .  " I do n't want to go into more details than that but there are more details and they are bitter .  There are terrorists they are sheltering and they make Sudanese passorts for them and they get paid by them , " Mubarak said .

Machado , 19 , flew to Los Angeles after slipping away from the New Mexico desert town of Las Cruces , where she attended the 1996 Miss Teen USA pageant on Wednesday .  While Machado was not a contestant here , she came under intense scrutiny following reports she was given an ultimatum by Los Angeles-based Miss Universe Inc. to drop 27 pounds ( 12 kg ) in two weeks or risk losing her crown .  In Venezuela , her mother told Reuters that Machado had a swollen face when she left home two weeks ago because she had her wisdom teeth extracted .  Marta Fajardo insisted her daughter , who weighed 112 pounds ( 51 kg ) when she won the Miss Universe title in Las Vegas in May , had perfectly normal eating habits .  " Everybody has their own addiction to something or other but it 's not as if she eats cakes like crazy , " she said .  Organisers flatly denied ever threatening Machado but immediately put her under wraps and blocked access to her .  Dressed in a black strapless evening gown at Wednesday 's pageant , Machado was clearly heavier than the contestants but still won rave reviews after her brief appearance on stage .  " Are you kidding ?  She 's fantastic , " said Nikki Campbell , 28 , who went to the pageant . "  She looked great .  Very sexy . "  Machado 's publicists said on Thursday she was scheduled to stay in Los Angeles for promotional work with sponsors before returning to Venezuela on Sept .  5 .  Beauty queens are high-profile personalities in Venezuela and Machado 's alleged weight problem made front page news this week .  It was an official of the Miss Venezuela Organisation who first said Machado had been told to lose weight fast .  People close to her said she then eased up on her diet and indulged her passion for pasta and cake , but it was not clear how many pounds she gained and most people who saw her said she was still a long way from being fat .  Martin Brooks , president of Miss Universe Inc , said he spoke with Machado to assure her that organisers were not putting pressure on her .  " She 's fine with it .  She wished , as we all did , that it had n't happened but she 's spiritually and mentally terrific .  There 's no problem whatsoever , " he told Reuters .  He said the lifestyle associated with being Miss Universe could make routine exercise difficult .  " The problem is they travel so much and are so busy that the ability to have any type of regimented routine workout does n't exist .  I dont know if Alicia is working out .  We have n't talked about it because it has n't been an issue , " he said .  -DOCSTART-  Kevorkian attends third suicide in week .

Andrew Gray  HAMBURG , Germany 1996-08-22  A Hamburg court sentenced U.S. neo-Nazi leader Gary Lauck on Thursday to four years in prison for pumping banned extremist propaganda into Germany from his base in the United States .  Lauck , from Lincoln , Nebraska , yelled a tirade of abuse at the court after his conviction for inciting racial hatred .  " The struggle will go on , " the 43-year-old shouted in German before being escorted out by security guards .  Lauck 's lawyer vowed he would appeal against the court 's decision , arguing that his client should have been set free because he had not committed any offence under German law .  The German government hailed the conviction as a major victory in the fight against neo-Nazism .  Lauck 's worldwide network has been the main source of anti-Semitic propaganda material flowing into Germany since the 1970s .  " Lauck possessed a well-oiled propaganda machine , honed during more than 20 years , " presiding judge Guenter Bertram told the court .  " He set up a propaganda cannon and fired it at Germany . "  said Bertram , who also read out extracts from Lauck 's material praising Hitler as " the greatest of all leaders " and describing the Nazi slaughter of millions of Jews as a myth .  Eager to put Lauck behind bars quickly and avoid a long and complex trial , prosecutor Bernd Mauruschat limited his charges to offences since 1994 .  He had demanded a five-year jail term but said he was satisfied with the court 's sentence .  Publishing and distributing neo-Nazi material is illegal in Germany but Lauck 's defence team had argued that U.S freedom of speech laws meant he was free to produce his swastika-covered books , magazines , videos and flags in his homeland .  Interior Minister Manfred Kanther said in a statement he " welcomed the prosecution and conviction of one of the ringleaders of international neo-Nazism and biggest distributers of vicious racist publications " .  " It is high time he was behind bars , " the opposition Social Democrats said in a statement .  Lauck , dressed in a sober blue suit and sporting his trademark Hitleresque black moustache , showed no sign of emotion as Bertram spent more than an hour reading out the verdict and explaining the court 's decision .  But as Lauck was about to be led away , he turned to reporters and blurted out a virtually incomprehensible quick-fire diatribe against the court .  " Neither the National Socialists ( Nazis ) nor the communists dared to kidnap an American citizen , " he shouted , in an oblique reference to his extradition to Germany from Denmark . "  That 's the truth . "  His attorney , Hans-Otto Sieg , told reporters outside the courtroom that the judges had not explained how a German court could judge someone for actions carried out in the United States .  Bertram said Lauck was obsessed by Nazism and devoted his life to leading his National Socialist German Workers ' Party Foreign Organisation ( NSDAP-AO ) , which derives its name from the full German title of Hitler 's Nazi party .  During the three-month trial , the court dealt mainly with issues of the NSDAP-AO 's " NS Kampfruf " ( " National Socialist Battle Cry " ) magazine , filled with references to Aryan supremacy and defamatory statements about Jews .  The court rejected Sieg 's argument that Lauck 's extradition from Denmark , where he was arrested in March last year at the request of German authorities , was illegal .  Lauck was also convicted of disseminating the symbols of anti-constitutional organisations .  He will probably be free in around two and a half years .  The court ruled that the 15 months he has spent in custody since his arrest should be subtracted from his prison term .  -DOCSTART-  UN official says Iraqi deal will occur " soon " .

PARIS 1996-08-22  Algerian security forces have shot dead three Moslem guerrillas suspected of killing a leading French bishop in western Algeria , the Algerian state-run television said on Thursday .  Security forces also arrested four other men sought for giving support to the slain Moslem rebels , the television said .  The television , which did not say when the security forces killed the rebels , said the four arrested men confessed details of the assassination of the French Roman Catholic Bishop Pierre Claverie .  The 58-year-old Claverie was killed in August 1 in a bomb blast at his residence in the western Algerian city of Oran , hours after he met visiting French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette in Algiers .  An estimated 50,000 Algerians and more than 110 foreigners have been killed in Algeria 's violence pitting Moslem rebels against the Algerian government forces since early 1992 , when the authorities cancelled a general election in which radical Islamists took a commanding lead .  -DOCSTART-  German flown cargo January-July rise 3.8 percent .

Two residents of the Atlantic resort , where Clinton was to have played golf with the Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring , have been invited to the Democratic party convention in Chicago on August 26-29 .  They have been asked to bring with them the placards they waved when Clinton addressed Ireland at a packed ceremony in Dublin city centre on December 1 , last year .

BONN 1996-08-22  Germany said on Thursday it had received assurances from the Russian government that its forces would observe the latest ceasefire in Chechnya .  Foreign Ministry spokesman Martin Erdmann said top Bonn diplomat Wolfgang Ischinger had been assured by senior Russian officials that the ultimatum to storm and take the Chechen capital of Grozny was not valid .  " The Russian side confirmed that the ceasefire is in place and they will keep to it , " Erdmann told Reuters after speaking by telephone to Ischinger , who had met the officials on a two-day visit to Moscow .  He returned to Bonn on Thursday .  Ischinger is the political director of Bonn 's foreign ministry .  Ischinger said he met three Russian deputy foreign ministers and a vice defence minister , who confirmed Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov 's pledge that Moscow would seek a political solution under the aegis of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) .  " The ultimatum ( to storm Grozny ) is no longer an issue , " he said quoting Ischinger , who had been sent to Moscow by German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel as his personal envoy to urge an end to Moscow 's military campaign in the breakaway region .  Ischinger said the threat of a major assault to take Grozny had been the unauthorised initiative of the commanding general and not Moscow 's intention .  The officials had been positive about Kinkel 's request on Wednesday that President Boris Yeltsin 's security chief Alexander Lebed should , on his return to Moscow , meet Tim Goldiman , the OSCE representative responsible for Chechnya , he said .  -DOCSTART-  India says sees no arms race with China , Pakistan .  NEW DELHI 1996-08-22  India said on Thursday that its opposition to a global nuclear test ban treaty did not mean New Delhi intended to enter into an arms race with neighbouring Pakistan and China .  Foreign Minister I.K. Gujral was asked at a news conference if India 's decision to block adoption of the accord in Geneva would lead to an arms race with Pakistan and China .  " I do n't see that possibility because India is not entering into any arms race , " he said . "  Our not signing a new treaty does not mean we are going in for any new kind of weapons , particularly nuclear . "  China , along with Britain , France , Russia and the United States , is a declared nuclear power .  India carried out a nuclear test in 1974 but says it has not built the bomb .  Experts believe both India and Pakistan could quickly assemble nuclear weapons .  Gujral said he did not expect India 's veto of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty ( CTBT ) to damage bilateral ties with other nations .  " I do not visualise its straining our bilateral relations with any country .  The text has already been blocked , " he said .  Gujral said India would re-examine its position if the treaty , particularly a clause providing for its entry into force , was modified .  Asked what India would do if the pact were forwarded to the United Nations General Assembly , Gujral said : " That bridge I will cross when I come to it . "  In a written statement released at the news conference , Gujral reiterated India 's objections to the treaty , under negotiation at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva .  " It is a sad fact that the nuclear weapon states show no interest in giving up their nuclear hegemony , " the statement said .  Gujral said India had national security concerns that made it impossible for New Delhi to sign the CTBT .  " Our security concerns oblige us to maintain our nuclear option , " he said , adding that India had exercised restraint in not carrying out any nuclear tests since the country 's lone test blast in 1974 .  He said : " We cannot accept constraints on our option as long as nuclear weapon states continue to rely on their nuclear arsenals for their security " .  -DOCSTART-  Britain says death of its citizen will sour ties .  DHAKA 1996-08-22  A British minister expressed his government 's official disquiet on Thursday at the recent death of a British citizen of Bangladeshi origin at Dhaka airport .  " I have told Bangladesh leaders that British goverment has attached serious importance to the resolution of the tragic death of Siraj Mia , " Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs Liam Fox Fox , told reporters .  Siraj Mia died at Dhaka airport on May 9 during interogation by customs officials after arriving from London .  His body bore multiple injuries , and his relatives complained that he was murdered .  A post-mortem report suggested he might have been tortured .  But customs authorities said the passenger was drunk and died of loss of blood from a deep cut in his wrist after he hit a glass sheet .  Fox , who arrived in Bangladesh on Tuesday on four-day visit , said Britain wanted Dhaka to act seriously on the case .  " This is one of the reasons of my visit here ...  this is an important issue in our relationship " , said Fox , who is due to leave for Nepal on Friday .  Fox said the incident had strained relations between the two governments .  He said the Mia 's issue had been raised in the House of Commons .  Fox said he had brought up the issue at every meeting he had had with government leaders in Dhaka .  He said the Bangladesh government had assured him it was taking the matter seriously .  " The British government wants a thorough investigation and a just outcome , " he said .  Fox said the British government wanted an end to the alleged harassment of its nationals at Dhaka airport by customs officials .  Bangladesh 's Criminal Investigation Department has charged two immigration officials in connection with Mia 's killing .  Mia , a father of five children , had a restaurant business in a London suburb .  -DOCSTART-  India fears attempts to disrupt Kashmir polls .  SRINAGAR , India 1996-08-22  India 's Home ( interior ) Minister accused Pakistan on on Thursday of planning to disrupt state elections in troubled Jammu and Kashmir state .  " It seems that from across the border there is going to be a planned attempt to disrupt the elections , " Inderjit Gupta told reporters in the state capital Srinagar .  The local polls next month will be the first since 1987 in the state , clamped under direct rule from New Delhi since 1990 .  India has often accused Pakistan of abetting militancy in the valley , a charge Islamabad has always denied .  Gupta said there might be an increase in the number of people infiltrating the Kashmir valley to create disturbance in the region .  " We noticed among the people who come from across the border , there is a growing number of foreign mercenaries , " Gupta said .  India and Pakistan have fought two of their three wars over the troubled region of Kashmir since independence from Britain in 1947 .  Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda 's centre-left government hopes the elections will help restore normality and democratic rule in Jammu and Kashmir , where more than 20,000 people have died in insurgency-related violence since 1990 .  Over a dozen militant groups are fighting New Delhi 's rule in the state .  -DOCSTART-  Dhaka stocks end up on gains by engineering , banks .

NEW DELHI 1996-08-22  The Reserve bank of India governor C. Rangarajan said on Thursday that he expected the cash reserve ratio ( CRR ) maintained by banks to be reduced over the medium term .  " Over the medium term , yes , " he told Reuters after addressing industrialists in the capital .  He denied having said in a recent newspaper interview that the CRR could be raised if necessary .  He said he was only trying ( in that newspaper report ) to explain the theoretical position on the use of the CRR by central banks to manage money supply .  Rangarajan explained that the cash reserve ratio was an instrument that central banks could use to regulate money supply by reducing or increasing the ratio .  But in the current context , the government stood by an earlier commitment to reduce it over a period of time , he said in response to a question .  -- New Delhi newsroom , +91-11-3012024  -DOCSTART-  Two pct India current account deficit viable - RBI .  BOMBAY 1996-08-22  The Reserve Bank of India Governor Chakravarty Rangarajan said on Thursday that a current account deficit of two percent of gross domestic product ( GDP ) was sustainable given the currrent rate of growth .  " The current account deficit of around two percent of GDP is a sustainable level of deficit given the expected real growth rate and the trends in imports and exports , " Rangarajan said in an address to business leaders in New Delhi .  Rangarajan said a current account deficit of two percent brought about by a 16-17 percent annual growth in exports and a 14-15 percent rise in imports along with an increase in non-debt flows could lead to a reduction in the debt-service ratio to below 20 percent over the next five years .  -- Bombay newsroom +91-22-265 9000  -DOCSTART-  Mother Teresa devoted to world 's poor .  CALCUTTA 1996-08-22  Mother Teresa , known as the Saint of the Gutters , won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979 for bringing hope and dignity to millions of poor , unwanted people with her simple message : " The poor must know that we love them . "  While the world heaps honours on her and even regards her as a living saint , the nun of Albanian descent maintains she is merely doing God 's work .  " It gives me great joy and fulfilment to love and care for the poor and neglected , " she said . "  The poor do not need our sympathy and pity .  They need our love and compassion . "  The diminutive Roman Catholic missionary was on respiratory support in intensive care in an Indian nursing home on Thursday after suffering heart failure .  But an attending doctor said Mother Teresa , who turns 86 next Tuesday , was conscious and in stable condition .  The task Mother Teresa began alone in 1949 in the slums of densely-populated Calcutta , and grew to touch the hearts of people around the world .  When in 1979 she was told she had won the Nobel Peace Prize , she said characteristically : " I am unworthy . "  The world disagreed , showering more than 80 national and international honours on her including the Bharat Ratna , or Jewel of India , the country 's highest civilian award .  Her health began to deteriorate in 1989 when she was fitted with a heart pacemaker .  A year later , the Vatican announced she was stepping down as Superior of her Missionaries of Charity order .  More than 100 delegates flew in from around the world to elect a successor .  They could not agree , so asked her to stay on .  She agreed .  In 1991 , Mother Teresa was treated at a California hospital for heart disease and bacterial pneumonia .  In 1993 , she fell in Rome and broke three ribs .  In August the same year , while in New Delhi to receive yet another award , she developed malaria , complicated by her heart and lung problems .  Last April she fractured her left collar bone .  But her increasing frailty , arthritis and failing eyesight has not stopped her travels around the world to mingle with the poor and desperate .  Mother Teresa was born Agnes Goinxha Bejaxhiu to Albanian parents in Skopje , in what was then Serbia , on August 27 , 1910 .  She attended a government school and was already deeply religious by the time she was 12 .  At the age of 18 she became a Loretto nun , hoping to work at the Order 's Calcutta mission .  She was sent to Loretto Abbey in Dublin and from there to India to begin her novitiate and teach geography at a convent school in Calcutta .  She said her divine call to work among the poor came in September , 1946 . "  The message was quite clear , " she told one interviewer . "  I was to leave the convent and help the poor while living among them .  It was an order .  I knew where I belonged . "  The Vatican and the mother superior in Dublin approved and after intensive training as a nurse with American missionaries she opened her first Calcutta slum school in December 1949 .  She took the name of Teresa , after France 's Saint Therese of the Child Jesus .  In India she was simply called Mother .  Mother Teresa set up her first home for the dying in a Hindu rest house in Calcutta after she saw a penniless woman turned away by a city hospital .  Named " Nirmal Hriday " ( Tender Heart ) , it was the first of a chain of 150 homes for dying , destitute people , admitting nearly 18,000 a year .  Her Missionaries of Charity , a Roman Catholic religious order she founded in 1949 , now runs about 300 homes for unwanted children and the destitute in India and abroad .  In 1994 a British television documentary called the myth around Mother Teresa a mixture of " hyperbole and credulity " .  Catholics around the world rose to her defence .  -DOCSTART-  RTRS - FOCUS-News forecasts alien-led profit boost .  Bernard Hickey  SYDNEY 1996-08-22  Media baron Rupert Murdoch 's News Corp Ltd reported lower than expected 1995/96 profits on Thursday , but forecast that the hit film " Independence Day " would help increase profits by at least 20 percent in 1996/97 .  " From an earnings perspective , the current fiscal year has begun with great promise due to the hit motion picture ' Independence Day , ' " News Corp said in a statement announcing its results for the year to June 30 , 1996 .  It said moderating paper prices and solid orders for advertising at its Fox Broadcasting television network in the United States would also help boost profits in the 1996/97 year . "  A budgeted profit increase of at least 20 percent for the full year currently appears very attainable , " News Corp said .  The bullish comments for the coming year soothed analysts and most shareholders , who were disappointed by the lower than expected profit for 1995/96 .  News announced pre-abnormals net profit for the year fell six percent to A$ 1.26 billion ( US$ 995 million ) and earnings per share dropped to 40 cents from 46 cents .  Analysts had on average expected a pre-abnormals profit of A$ 1.343 billion .  " The year just gone was disappointing , but the outlook for the current year looks good , " First Pacific media analyst Lachlan Drummond said .  News Corp said strong performances in U.S. television and British newspapers were offset by lower profits from News Corp 's magazine and publishing divisions and further hefty losses from its Asian Star TV operations .  Higher newsprint prices hit profits hard . "  Throughout the group , higher paper prices increased costs by over US$ 300 million , " it said .  News Corp said British newspaper operating profits rose 10 percent for the year , as higher cover prices at The Sun and The Times and higher advertising volumes offset increased newsprint costs .  Advertising revenues at The Times grew 20 percent .  Analysts said sharply lower earnings from News Corp 's book publishing division and its U.S. magazines had been the major surprises in the results for 1995/96 .  News Corp said revenue gains at its magazines and inserts division were offset by higher paper prices and lower sales at the U.S. TV Guide .  News said dramatically lower earnings from the British arm of its Harper-Collins publishing division more than offset healthy results from its U.S. operation .  It said the demise of the Net Book Agreement had hurt the British operations , and weak performances from the San Francisco unit of Harper-Collins had not helped .  The minimum price setting expired last September when three publishers pulled out .  But it was the bullish profit forecast for 1996/97 that took the spotlight in the market , with some analysts saying 20 percent may even be an understatement .  " If they 're saying at least 20 percent , then their internal forecasts are probably saying 25 or 30 percent , " said one Sydney media analyst who declined to be named .  News Corp 's shares were down eight cents at A$ 6.39 at 2.00 p.m. ( 0400 GMT ) in a soft market .

" The government 's announced plans to balance the budget , if realised , would make a useful contribution to raising national savings , " the RBA said .

Rostislav Khotin  KIEV 1996-08-23  Ukraine celebrates five years of independence from Kremlin rule on Saturday , hailing civil and inter-ethnic peace as its main post-Soviet achievement .  Ukraine 's declaration of independence in 1991 , backed nine-to-one by a referendum in December of that year , effectively dealt a death blow to the Soviet empire and ended more than three centuries of rule from Moscow .  Ukraine , with a Russian community of 11 million people -- the world 's largest outside Russia -- has avoided conflicts like those in Russia 's Chechnya , neighbouring Moldova , and the former Soviet republics of Georgia , Azerbaijan and Tajikistan .  " Ukraine 's biggest achievements for five years are the preservation of civil peace and inter-ethnic harmony , " President Leonid Kuchma said in televised statement this week .  " Unlike many other post-Soviet countries we were able to deal with conflict situations in a peaceful and civilised way . "  But independence was initially accompanied by hyper-inflation and economic collapse , although there are signs of a turnaround .  Inflation -- a hyper-inflationary 10,300 percent a year in 1993 -- was a respectable 0.1 percent a month in June and July and the economy has just begun to grow .  Kuchma told a solemn ceremony at the Ukraina Palace on Friday that " there was a turning point " in reforms and that he expected a rise in the standard of living in the near future .  " There is no doubt that economic growth has already started , " said Adelbert Knobl , head of the International Monetary Fund 's mission in Ukraine . "  The national bank and the government have every reason to be proud of their efforts . "  Central bank officials said on Thursday that a much-postponed hryvna currency would " definitely " be introduced before the end of this year .  It will replace the interim karbovanets currency , which was introduced at par to the Russian rouble in 1992 but now trades at almost 33 karbovanets per rouble .  Ukraine has repeatedly promised to introduce the hryvna but had to postpone the plans because of economic problems .  Proud of its record in promptly joining both the Council of Europe and NATO 's Partnership for Peace , Ukraine caused a foreign policy wrangle this week , offending China by allowing a Taiwanese minister to appear on a public , if unofficial visit .  China cancelled a visit by a top-level delegation in protest .  Kiev 's Foreign Minister Hennady Udovenko said Beijing was overreacting .  But Ukraine , seeing itself as a bridge between Russia and the rapidly Westernising countries of eastern Europe , is looking West as well as East .  " The strategic aim of European integration should not in any way damage Ukraine 's interests in post-Soviet areas .  Relations with Russia , which is our main partner , have great importance , " Kuchma said .  " But Ukraine cannot be economically oriented on Russia , even though those in some circles push us to do that . "  Kuchma has said Kiev wants membership of the European Union , associate membership of the Western European Union defence grouping and to move closer to NATO .  A message from the West this week from U.S. President Bill Clinton congratulated Ukraine on the anniversary , promising to support market reforms and praising Ukraine as a " stabilising factor " in a united Europe .  -DOCSTART-  Oldest Albania book disappears from Vatican - paper .  TIRANA 1996-08-23  A 16th-century document , the earliest complete example of written Albanian , has disappeared from the Vatican archives , an Albanian newspaper said on Friday .  Gazeta Shqiptare said the " Book of Mass ' , by Gjon Buzuku , dating from 1555 and discovered in 1740 in a religious seminary in Rome , was the first major document published in the Albanian language .  " We Albanians , sons of Buzuku , believed our language had a written document but now we do not have it any more , " lamented scholar Musa Hamiti , told of the loss by the Vatican library .  Tirana 's national library has three copies of the " Book of Mass ' . "  There is nothing left for us but to be grateful to civilisation for inventing photocopies , " Gazeta Shqiptare said .  -DOCSTART-  Russia to clamp down on barter deals .  MOSCOW 1996-08-23  Russian officials , keen to cut capital flight , will adopt tight measures to cut barter deals in foreign trade to a minimum , a customs official said on Friday .  " We have always been concerned about barter deals with other countries , viewing them as a disguised kind of capital flight from Russia , " Marina Volkova , deputy head of the currency department at the State Customs Committee , told Reuters .  Volkova said last year goods had been exported under many Russian barter deals , with nothing imported in return .  She said the cost of such unimported goods was $ 1.10 billion in 1995 .  Barter deals were worth $ 4.9 billion last year , or about eight percent of all Russian exports estimated at $ 61.5 billion , she said .  " The cost of exported goods is too often understated , so the actual share of barter deals in Russian exports and the amount of unimported goods may be even higher , " Volkova said .  A few days ago Russian President Boris Yeltsin issued a decree on state regulation of foreign barter deals , and Volkova said this " could substantially improve the situation " .  In line with the decree , which will come into force on November 1 , all Russian barter traders will be obliged to import goods worth the cost of their exports within 180 days .  " If traders are late , they will have to pay fines worth the cost of their exported goods , " Volkova said .  Understating the cost of exported goods could still be a loophole for barter dealers , but Volkova said the authorities are currently " tackling the technicalities of the issue " .  Barter has always been a feature of the Soviet Union 's foreign trade , but Yeltsin 's decrees liberalising foreign trade in 1991-1992 has given barter a new impetus .  A few years ago , barter deals accounted for up to 25-30 percent of Russian exports because " thousands ( of ) trade companies which popped up preferred barter in the absence of reliable Russian banks and money transfer systems " , Volkova said .  " Now many Russian banks are strong and can make various sorts of money tranfers , while incompetent traders are being ousted by more experienced ones .  But the current share of barter deals in Russian exports is still high , " she said .  -- Dmitry Solovyov , Moscow Newsroom , +7095 941 8520  -DOCSTART-  Viacom plans " Mission " sequel - report .  LOS ANGELES 1996-08-22  Paramount Pictures is going ahead with a sequel to the Tom Cruise blockbuster , " Mission : Impossible " and hopes to release it in the summer of 1998 , Daily Variety reported in its Friday edition .  The big-screen version of the spy TV series has grossed $ 175 million domestically since opening May 22 , and $ 338 million overseas so far .  It 's the biggest success for Viacom Inc-owned Paramount since 1994 's " Forrest Gump " .  However , many critics complained its plot was incomprehensible .  Cruise will reprise his roles as star and co-producer , and will soon meet Academy Award-winning screenwriter William Goldman , who will write the script , the report said .  It said " Mission : Impossible " director Brian De Palma would have first crack at the sequel , though no deals have been made yet .  Goldman , whose Oscars were for " Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid " and " All the President 's Men " , earlier this summer criticised some of the season 's blockbusters .  However , he singled out " Mission : Impossible " as an especially entertaining movie , Daily Variety said .  -DOCSTART-  CRICKET - CRAWLEY FORCED TO SIT AND WAIT .  LONDON 1996-08-23  England batsman John Crawley was forced to endure a frustrating delay of over three hours before resuming his quest for a maiden test century in the third test against Pakistan on Friday .  Heavy overnight rain and morning drizzle ruled out any play before lunch on the second day but an improvement in the weather prompted the umpires to announce a 1415 local time ( 1315 GMT ) start in the event of no further rain .  Crawley , unbeaten on 94 overnight in an England total of 278 for six , was spotted strumming a guitar in the dressing-room as the Oval ground staff took centre stage .  There were several damp patches on the square and the outfield and it was still raining when the players took an early lunch at 1230 local time ( 1130 GMT ) .  When brighter weather finally arrived , the umpires announced a revised figure of 67 overs to be bowled with play extended to at least 1900 local time ( 1800 GMT ) .  -DOCSTART-  MOTOR RACING - BELGIAN GRAND PRIX PRACTICE TIMES .

TORONTO 1996-08-22  It was Australia Day at the $ 2 million Canadian Open on Thursday as three Aussies reached the quarter-finals with straight-set victories .  Unseeded Patrick Rafter recorded the most noteworthy result as he upset sixth-seeded American MaliVai Washington 6-2 6-1 in just 50 minutes .  Todd Woodbridge , who defeated Canadian Daniel Nestor 7-6 ( 7-2 ) 7-6 ( 7-4 ) , and Mark Philippoussis , a 6-3 6-4 winner over Bohdan Ulihrach of the Czech Republic , also advanced and will meet in Friday 's quarter-finals .  Third-seeded Wayne Ferreira of South Africa defeated Tim Henman of Britain 6-4 6-4 after a three-hour evening rain delay and fifth-seeded Thomas Enqvist of Sweden won his third-round match , eliminating Petr Korda of the Czech Republic 6-3 6-4 .  Ferreira and Enqvist play in a Friday night quarter-final .  Two Americans , seventh seed Todd Martin and unseeded Alex O'Brien , will meet on Friday after winning matches on Thursday .  Martin overcame Cedric Pioline of France 2-6 6-2 6-4 and O'Brien beat Mikael Tillstrom of Sweden 6-3 2-6 6-3 .  " If you really look at the match , " said the 12th-ranked Washington after losing to the 70th-ranked Rafter , " I never really got a chance to play because he was serving big and getting in close to the net .  " He was also able to handle my serve pretty easily because my ( first ) service percentage was only in the 40s .  Put those two things together and you get a loss . "  Rafter missed 10 weeks after wrist surgery earlier this year and the time away from tennis has given him a new perspective .  " Before when I was on tour , I always felt I had to be in bed by 9:30 or 10 o'clock and I had to be up at a certain time , " Rafter said . "  Now I can go to bed at at midnight or wake up at seven in the morning .  I just do n't have as many set routines and it 's made me a happier person . "  Martin was pleased with his victory over Pioline , his first in five meetings with the 11th-ranked Frenchman . "  It 's always difficult to win a match when you lose the first set , especially against someone you have never beaten , " he said .  " I got more aggressive in the second and third sets and the wind picked up and that also affected things because Cedric definitely went off a little bit . "  The 26-year-old O'Brien , who won the ATP Tour stop in New Haven last week , has now won 18 of his last 20 matches , dating back to qualifying rounds in Los Angeles in late July .  He ranks 76th after being 285th four weeks ago .  " I feel I 'm hitting the ball well even though I 'm having more mental letdowns than I did last week , " O'Brien said . "  But I 'm still competing well . "  " I got a lot of first serves in , " said Enqvist about his victory over Korda . "  I did n't miss that many shots and he was making the mistakes . "  Still marvelling at an exciting 64-stroke rally he won in the last game of his second-round match against Javier Sanchez of Spain on Tuesday , Enqvist joked , " Today against Petr there were about 64 strokes in the whole match .  It was mostly short points . "  -DOCSTART-  TENNIS - RESULTS AT CANADIAN OPEN .

The 20-year-old Rubin , who was to be seeded 11th , is still suffering from tendinitis of the right wrist that has kept her sidelined in recent months .  Rubin 's misfortune turned into a very lucky break for eighth-seeded Olympic champion Lindsay Davenport .  Davenport had drawn one of the toughest first-round assignments of any of the seeded players in 17th-ranked Karina Habsudova of Slovakia .  But as the highest-ranked non-seeded player in the tournament , Habsudova will be moved into Rubin 's slot in the draw , while Davenport will now get a qualifier in the first round , according to U.S. Tennis Association officials .  Rubin is the third notable withdrawal from the women 's competition after 12th-ranked former Australian Open champion Mary Pierce and 20th-ranked Wimbledon semifinalist Meredith McGrath pulled out earlier this week with injuries .

Moyer ( 10-2 ) , who was tagged for a pair of homers by Mike Devereaux and Brady Anderson and three runs in the ninth , walked none and struck out two .  Norm Charlton retired the final three batters to seal the victory .  With one out in the fifth Ken Griffey Jr and Edgar Martinez stroked back-to-back singles off Orioles starter Rocky Coppinger ( 7-5 ) and Jay Buhner walked .  Sorrento followed by hitting a 1-2 pitch just over the right-field wall for a 7-0 advantage .  Right fielder Bobby Bonilla was after the ball , which was touched by fans at the top of the scoreboard in right .  " Things fell in for us , " said Sorrento , who has six career grand slams and hit the ninth of the season for the Mariners .  " We have over a month left .  We 've got to make up some ground . "  In the American League wild-card race , the Mariners are three games behind the White Sox , two behind Baltimore and two ahead of the Red Sox heading into Boston for a weekend series .  Moyer retired 11 straight batters between the third and seventh innings and threw two or fewer pitches to 11 of the 29 batters he faced .  " I made some bad pitches at the end but I 'm not going to dwell on it .  We won the game , " said Moyer .  Coppinger ( 7-5 ) was tagged for eight runs and 10 hits in 4 1/3 innings .  Orioles manager Davey Johnson missed the game after being admitted to a hospital with an irregular heartbeat .  Bench coach Andy Etchebarren took his place .

In Kansas City , Travis Fryman doubled in the go-ahead run in the fifth and Melvin Nieves and Damion Easley belted two-run homers as the Detroit Tigers claimed a 10-3 win over the Royals , handing them their fifth straight loss .

Tim Belcher ( 12-8 ) was tagged for six runs and nine hits in eight innings .  At Minnesota , Ken Hill allowed two runs en route to his sixth complete game of the season and Rusty Greer added three hits , including a homer , and two RBI as the red-hot Texas Rangers routed the Twins 11-2 .

He has yielded just seven runs in his last four starts , covering 33 1/3 innings .  In Chicago , Erik Hanson outdueled Alex Fernandez , and Jacob Brumfield drove in Otis Nixon with the game 's only run in the sixth inning as the Toronto Blue Jays blanked the White Sox 1-0 in a game shortened to six innings due to rain .  Toronto won its fifth straight and handed the White Sox their seventh loss in nine games .

Schalke , who finished third last season , raced to a 3-1 lead at halftime .  St Pauli pulled a goal back through Andre Trulsen but Schalke striker Martin Max restored his team 's two-goal cushion shortly afterwards .  Christian Springer put St Pauli back in touch in the 64th minute and three minutes later they were level , thanks to a penalty from Thomas Sabotzik .  In the night 's only other match , Hamburg beat Hansa Rostock 1-0 , Karsten Baeron scoring the winner after some dazzling build-up from in-form midfielder Harald Spoerl .

Adrian Warner  BRUSSELS 1996-08-23  Russia 's double Olympic champion Svetlana Masterkova smashed her second world record in just 10 days on Friday when she bettered the mark for the women 's 1,000 metres .  After breaking the world record for the women 's mile in Zurich last Wednesday , the Olympic 800 and 1,500 metres champion clocked two minutes 28.98 seconds over 1,000 at the Brussels grand prix meeting .  The Russian ate up the ground in a swift last lap to shave 0.36 seconds off the previous best of 2:29.34 set by Mozambique 's Maria Mutola in the same stadium in August last year .  Former world 800 champion Mutola pushed Masterkova all the way , finishing second in 2:29.66 .  But it was the Russian who picked up the bonus of $ 25,000 for the historic run in front of a capacity 40,000 crowd .  Masterkova dominated the middle-distance races at the recent Atlanta Games following her return to competition this season after a three-year maternity break .  In her first mile race at the richest meeting in Zurich last Wednesday , she slashed 3.05 seconds off the previous record .  The record of four minutes , 12.56 seconds in Zurich earned Masterkova a bonus of $ 50,000 plus one kilo of gold .  After Friday 's performance the Russian will have earned well over $ 100,000 in less than a fortnight , taking her appearance money into account .  Brussels organisers had laid a new track for the meeting comparable to the surface at the Atlanta Games but put down on a softer surface .  Masterkova clearly enjoyed it .  Mutola looked threatening in the final 200 metres but the Russian found an extra gear to power home several strides ahead , pointing at the time on the clock with delight as she crossed the line .  -DOCSTART-  ATHLETICS - WOMEN 'S 1,000 METRES WORLD RECORD EVOLUTION .

Adrian Warner  BRUSSELS 1996-08-23  American Dennis Mitchell upstaged a trio of past and present Olympic 100 metres champions on Friday with a storming victory at the Brussels grand prix .  Sporting his customary bright green outfit , the U.S. champion clocked 10.03 seconds despite damp conditions to take the scalp of Canada 's reigning Olympic champion Donovan Bailey , 1992 champion Linford Christie of Britain and American 1984 and 1988 champion Carl Lewis .  Mitchell also beat world and Olympic champion Bailey at the most lucrative meeting in the sport in Zurich last week .  The American , who finished fourth at the Atlanta Games , was fast out of his blocks and held off Bailey 's late burst in the final 20 metres before heading off for a lap of celebration .  The Canadian was second in 10.09 with Lewis third in 10.10 , ahead of Atlanta bronze medallist Ato Boldon who clocked 10.12 in fourth .  Christie , competing in what is expected to be his last major international meeting , finished fifth in 10.14 .  Lewis , making a rare appearance in Europe in a sprint race , left the track with a slight limp .  American Olympic high hurdles champion Allen Johnson defied the wet conditions to produce a brilliant 12.92 seconds in the 110 metres race , just 0.01 outside the world record held by Britain 's Colin Jackson .  Johnson ran the same time at the U.S. Olympic trials in Atlanta in June to become the second equal fastest hurdler of all time with American Roger Kingdom .  He seemed to relish the new track at the Brussels meeting , dominating the race from start to finish with a slight wind at his back .  Jackson , the only man to have run faster , could not live with his speed , taking second in 13.24 seconds .  The rain was pelting down when the women 's high hurdlers stepped up for their 100 metres race .  But Sweden 's Olympic high hurdles champion Ludmila Engquist , who crashed out of last week 's meeting in Zurich after hitting a hurdle , also kept her footing perfectly to win in a fast 12.60 seconds .  Olympic silver medallist Brigita Bukovec of Slovenia could finish only fifth in the race in 12.95 .  Jamaican Commonwealth champion Michelle Freeman took second in 12.77 ahead of Cuban Aliuska Lopez .  The Zurich fall cost Engquist a shot at a jackpot of 20 one-kg gold bars which can be won by athletes who clinch their events at all of the Golden Four series in Oslo , Zurich , Brussels and Berlin .  Seven athletes went into Friday 's penultimate meeting of the series with a chance of winning the prize and American men 's 400 metres hurdles champion Derrick Adkins kept his hopes alive in the competition by winning his event in 47.93 .  American Olympic champion Gail Devers clocked a swift 10.84 seconds on her way to victory in the women 's 100 metres , the second fastest time of the season and 0.10 seconds faster than her winning time in Atlanta .  Jamaican veteran Merlene Ottey , who beat Devers in Zurich after just missing out on the gold medal in Atlanta after a photo finish , had to settle for third place in 11.04 .  American world champion Gwen Torrence , the bronze medallist in Atlanta , was second in 11.00 .  It was a costly defeat for Ottey since it threw her out of the race for the Golden Four jackpot .  -DOCSTART-  ATHLETICS - BRUSSELS GRAND PRIX RESULTS .

MIAMI 1996-08-23  The U.S. and Colombian governments reached an agreement that will allow AMR Corp 's American Airlines to operate three round-trip flights between New York and Bogota , the Department of Transportation said Friday .  Under the agreement , which followed talks in Miami this week , AMR also will be allowed to shift up to four of the weekly flights it now operates between Miami and Colombia to its New York gateway .  The United States also will be able to designate one new all-cargo carrier for service between the two nations after two years .  Colombia was permitted to add a single additional round-trip flight to its current New York service , although it will not be able to do so while under Category Two ( Conditional ) status under the Federal Aviation Administration 's International Aviation Safety program .  Colombia would be allowed to add new service when its safety assessment has been improved , the department said .  With the exception of the new services just agreed to , the governments of the two nations have agreed to maintain their current level of routes and airlines for the next 2-1/2 years , the agreement said .  The agreement resolved a dispute that arose in June when Colombia turned down American 's request to operate flights between New York and Bogota , a denial that prompted the United States to charge that the Colombians were breaking a bilateral aviation agreement and to propose sanctions against one of two Colombian airlines , Avianca and ACES .  -DOCSTART-  Clean tanker fixtures and enquiries - 1754 GMT .

Ori Lewis  TAIBE , Israel 1996-08-23  For the first time in Israeli history , an Arab team will take the field when the National League soccer season starts on Saturday .  Hapoel Taibe fields four Jewish players and two foreign imports -- a Pole and a Romanian .  The rest of the side is made up mainly of Moslem Arabs .  The club , founded in 1961 , has a loyal following in Taibe , an Arab town of 28,000 in the heart of Israel .  But away from their home ground , they face unfriendly crowds who taunt the players with racist abuse .  " The very first thing we thought about after we knew we would be promoted was the game against Betar Jerusalem , " said Taibe supporter Karem Haj Yihye .  Two weeks ago Taibe , coached by Pole Wojtek Lazarek , met Betar , a club closely associated with the right-wing Likud party , for the first time in a Cup match in Jerusalem .  Chants from the crowd of " Death to the Arabs " , and bottle-throwing during the game marred the match which ended in a goalless draw .  One Taibe supporter required hospital treatment for cuts and bruises after a stone struck his head as he was driving from the stadium .  " We 're used to hearing the taunts of " Death to the Arabs ' , " said Sameh Haj Yihye , a Taibe resident who studies at Jerusalem 's Hebrew University . "  But we know that these are only words , nobody has died from hearing them and it only makes us support our team more vehemently . "  The dusty town of Taibe lacks the amenities of Jewish communities and many Israeli Arabs have long complained of state discrimination .  " There are no parks or empty areas of land around here , so when we want to play a friendly game of soccer we all load up in the car and travel to Tel Aviv , " 60 km ( 36 miles ) away , Sameh Haj Yihye said .  The town 's ramshackle 2,500-seat ground is accessible only by two dirt tracks .  " We plan to build a 10,000-seat stadium , but it may well be situated elsewhere , " said club chairman Abdul Rahman Haj Yihye . "  We will discuss this with the mayor and hopefully a new or refurbished ground will be completed by the start of the new year . "  In the meantime , Taibe will play all their heavily policed home matches at the Jewish coastal town of Netanya .  " We are Israelis , there is no question about that , " said Karem Haj Yihye , a hotel waiter .  " We do n't have any connection with the Palestinians , they live over there , " he said , pointing to the West Bank seven km ( four miles ) to the east .  " We do n't feel our club represents Palestinian Arabs , " said club chairman Abdul Rahman . "  We are trying to do all we can to run a professional outfit , we are pleased at any support we get , but do not go out looking to represent the whole Arab world .

The Russian army said earlier it was preparing to withdraw from the rebel-dominated southern mountains of the region as part of the peace deal reached with separatists on Thursday .  " There has been some shooting from their side but it has been relatively quiet , " said fighter Aslan Shabazov , a bearded man wearing a white t-shirt and camoflage trousers .  Soon after he spoke another burst of gunfire rocked the courtyard where the rebels had set up their base and a captured Russian T-72 tank roared out to investigate .  The separatists , who swept into Grozny on August 6 , still control large areas of the centre of town , and Russian soldiers are based at checkpoints on the approach roads .  " The ceasefire is being observed , " said woman soldier Svetlana Goncharova , 35 , short dark hair poking out from under a peaked camouflage cap .  A few helicopters flew overhead , firing off flares , but there was no shooting from the air .  The truce , the latest of several , was agreed in talks on Thursday between Russian peacemaker Alexander Lebed and rebel chief-of-staff Aslan Maskhadov .

Rana Sabbagh  AMMAN 1996-08-23  Jordan , which has blamed Iraq for bread riots last week , has asked an Iraqi diplomat to leave , official and diplomatic sources said on Friday .  The main Friday prayers in southern Jordan that were the starting point for the riots a week ago passed peacefully under tight security imposed by the army with only brief demonstrations reported .  Adel Ibrahim , the Iraqi embassy 's press attache , was asked to leave " because he was carrying out duties incompatible with diplomatic norms " , one source told Reuters , implying he was accused of spying .  Ibrahim told Reuters by telephone from his embassy office in Amman that he " had not been notified " of any explusion order .  The government declined official comment .  Ibrahim 's assistant , Hussein Khalaf , was expelled earlier this year for similar reasons amid rising tension in bilateral ties after King Hussein began calling for change in Baghdad following top Iraqi defections in August 1995 .  Iraq retaliated then by expelling a junior administrator working in the Jordanian embassy in Baghdad but has continued its policy of trying to avoid public conflicts with Jordan -- its only secure route to the rest of the world .  Jordan has accused Iraq and a local pro-Baghdad party for the country 's worst unrest in seven years which erupted after it almost doubled the prices of bread last week under radical economic reforms agreed with the International Monetary Fund .  In Karak , where two days of riots flared last Friday , a few hundred young men lingered outside Omari mosque on leaving , shouting slogans for about 15 minutes .  " Disperse , abstain from forming groups and help maintain order , " army officers , who has enforced a loose curfew since the riots , told the crowd through loudspeakers .  The men shouted " Allahu Akbar " ( God is Greatest ) as a former Islamist deputy , Ahmed Kafawin , told soldiers the crowd would not cause trouble .  He had earlier mounted the mosque 's pulpit to demand release of detainees , an end to raids on houses and the cancelling of the bread price rises .  Armoured cars had patrolled streets in Karak , traditional bastion of communist ideology and Baath socialism that swept the region in the 1950s , and guarded entrances to the hill-top city famed for its Crusader castle before the prayers .  There was also heavy security in the crowded centre of Amman , where smaller clashes had erupted last Saturday , but Friday prayers at the main mosque ended quietly as police in full riot gear looked on .  The Jordanian Arab Socialist Baath Party , which has one deputy in the 80-seat lower house of parliament , has denied involvement in unrest which it blamed on government policies and rising economic hardship .  Government attempts to link the rioting to foreign influence has been treated with derision by those in the streets who blame the protests on severe economic hardships .  -DOCSTART-  Turkey says killed 17 Kurd rebels in clashes .

Spokesman Glyn Davies said in a statement that the agreement followed direct U.S. contacts with Massoud Barzani , leader of the Kurdistan Democratic Party ( KDP ) , and Jalal Talabani , leader of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan ( PUK ) .

COLOMBO 1996-08-23  Sri Lanka said on Friday the United States had promised to stamp out any illegal activities on U.S. soil directed against the island 's government .  The Sri Lankan foreign ministry said in a statement : " The United States government sympathised with the current predicament Sri Lanka was facing . "  The statement said the U.S. government " would do all within its prevailing legal framework to prevent the use of American soil to perpetrate violence against the democratic government of Sri Lanka " .  It said the U.S. State Department 's coordinator for counter terrorism , Philip Wilcox , had expressed Washington 's support for the government when he visited Colombo this week .  Colombo has said it believes Tamil rebels , fighting a 13-year war for independence against the government , finance their military activity through funds extorted from expatriate Sri Lankans in western countries such as the United States .  U.S. embassy officials in Colombo were not immediately available to comment on the report .  Colombo estimates more than 50,000 people have been killed in the war between government forces and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam rebels in the island 's north and east .  -DOCSTART-  Nepal 's king leaves on week-long visit to China .

The constitutional monarch , who last visited China in 1993 , was scheduled to meet Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng during his visit , they said .  Foreign ministry officials gave no details of the issues the king , who was accompanied by Foreign Minister Prakash Chandra Lohani , would discuss with Chinese leaders .  The Himalayan kingdom , sandwiched between China and India , has traditionally sought to maintain close cooperation with its giant neighbours , and an equal distance from the two .

Madhusudan Munakarmi was arrested on Thursday after his neighbours informed police about the plight of 12-year old Dhiraj K.C. , who told police his employer used to tie him up with iron chains and locks concealed under his clothes .  The neighbours in Kathmandu called the police when they saw Dheeraj , employed by the man for the past nine months , limping because of the chains .  " I feared he would flee from work or steal my belongings , " the Kathmandu Post newspaper quoted Munakarmi as saying after his arrest .  If convicted , he faces a maximum of three years in jail under Nepal 's child protection laws .  -DOCSTART-  OPTIONS - Euro debt vols seen regrouping after fall .  LONDON 1996-08-23  Implied volatility of European bond and interest rate options should stabilise around current levels until early next week after falling before and after this week 's German-led cut in interest rates , traders said .  " Volatility has come off a lot .  We 're looking for it to stabilise now , " said one Euromark options trader at a U.S. bank .  A trader at a Japanese bank said Euromark volatility now stood at 14.00 for September contract , 16.75 for December , 19.50 for March and 21.25 for June .  This compared with midweek levels , before the welter of interest rate cuts , of 18.50 for September , 20.00 for December , 22.00 for March and 23.5 for June , he said .  At 1347 GMT , December Euromark futures were trading at 96.78 , two basis points down on the day .  He said the sell-off in June vols might have been overdone , which could offer value at current levels .  He said caps and floors would be well bid after the round of interest rate cuts due to the fact these rates should stay low at the short end .  The size of the Bundesbank 's repo rate cut , to 3.00 percent from 3.30 percent , took markets by surprise .  " Volatility has a bid to it -- longer-dated volatility more than short-dated because the event people were buying for has passed and now perhaps people will sell some short dated vol and buy some long dated vol , " he said .  " Long dated volatility has been low this year , so it is still at levels which are not historically high .  " It is not a dangerous level to own vol. You are not going to lose a lot and you could make quite a bit . "  He said volatility levels should be stable until markets reassess the situation after a long weekend in Britain .  Paribas Capital Markets OTC options specialist Robert Coughlan said that if volatility continued lower for the rest of Friday in over-the-counter 10-year Bunds , it should be higher next Tuesday .  He said the absence on holiday of many market makers was a main factor behind falls this week in volatility in high-yielding markets such as Italy , Spain and Sweden .  Coughlan said the market had more downside than upside potential , but a fall was not likely to be of significant size .  " I recommend people sell strangles in a number of markets -- in Germany and France in particular .  " With high-yielding markets Italy will be a lot more vulnerable in September on economic and political fronts , so I would use current the low level of vol to buy options .  " So sell options on Bunds and France to enhance yield and buy options on Italy , " Coughlan said ..  -- Stephen Nisbet , International Bonds +44 171 542 6320  -DOCSTART-  Goldman Sachs sets warrants on Continental .

LONDON 1996-08-23  A British photographer branded a stalker by Princess Diana has been forced to postpone a legal challenge to a ban on approaching her because he 's been jailed for criminal damage , his lawyer said on Friday .  Martin Stenning started a 12-week jail sentence on Thursday just as he was preparing to contest an injunction obtained by Diana banning him from coming within 300 metres ( yards ) of her .  " We were in the process of preparing a detailed affidavit responding to the Princess 's affadavit and expected to go to court in the next couple of weeks , " said Stenning 's lawyer , Benedict Birnberg . "  But everything has been put on ice now . "  Birnberg told Reuters that the challenge to the injunction would be delayed until Stenning was released .  Stenning threw a brick through the window of a van in February after an argument with a driver when he was working as a motorcycle dispatch rider .  Stenning , who has previous convictions , is expected to appeal against the sentence .  Magistrates also ordered him to pay compensation of 182 pounds ( $ 282 ) .  The freelance photographer was branded a stalker by Diana , whose divorce from heir-to-the-throne Prince Charles is due to become final next week , after persistently trailing her on his motorcycle .  In an affidavit , the princess said that in chasing her Stenning had got so close that he twice smashed into her car and pushed her when she tried to remove the film from his camera .  Stenning has rejected Diana 's claims and said he was being made a scapegoat to scare off press photographers .  -DOCSTART-  Jordan expels Iraqi diplomat .

He said Ibrahim was still in Amman .  The Jordanian Arab Socialist Baath Party has denied involvement in unrest which it blamed on government policies and rising economic hardship .

PKK guerrillas would accompany the soldiers , captured last spring in one of Turkey 's frequent cross-border drives , until they could be handed over , he said .  Their release has been negotiated by Islamist writer Ismail Nacar as part of a wider effort , partly backed by Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan , to find a political solution to Turkey 's Kurdish problem .  Erbakan has encouraged Nacar 's bid but has ruled out direct talks with the rebels .  The PKK often uses bases in northern Iraq in its fight for autonomy or independence in southeast Turkey .

Susan Nadeau  CHICAGO 1996-08-22  A consortium of telephone companies and The Walt Disney Co .  said Thursday it had signed a $ 1 billion contract with Zenith to make digital televison set-top boxes for its home entertainment service .  The announcement of the contract for 3 million set-top boxes gave new hope to Zenith , which has struggled with years of losses .  " This really indicates we 're back in the business , " William Luehrs , president of the Glenview , Ill.-based company 's Networks Services Division , said in a telephone interview . "  Anytime somebody gets the opportunity to enter the next era with such a big bang has got to be seen as a strong message to the industry . "  Following the announcement , Zenith 's stock soared $ 5.50 to $ 16.875 on the New York Stock Exchange .  The consortium , called Americast , said the contract was part of its strategy to develop and market the next generation in home entertainment .  In addition to Disney , Americast 's partners are phone companies Ameritech Corp. , BellSouth Corp. , GTE Corp. and SBC Communications .  Americast said Southern New England Telecommunications Corp. has signed a letter of intent to join the group , which plans to provide a home entertainment service similar to cable television .  Zenith also said it planned to build a new $ 100 million plant in Woodridge , Ill .  , to make picture tubes for 32- and 35-inch screen TV sets .  The company currently buys the tubes from competitors .  The new plant , which is dependent on obtaining financing , will create about 280 new jobs , Zenith said .  The contract calls for production of the set-top boxes over five years .  Luehrs said manufacturing will begin and revenue will start to roll in during the first half of next year .  The boxes will be made on a build-to-order basis .  Zenith will convert its Chihuahua , Mexico , analogue set-top box plant to manufacture the digital boxes .  Luehrs declined to say when the operation was expected to be profitable .  Americast will provide the boxes to subscribers as part of the service .  Its service is being introduced in selected markets across the United States .  Luehrs said digital technology in set-top boxes is only the beginning and said the technology will eventually show up in retail consumer electronics .  " We 'll build a lot of these devices into television sets , for digital television , " he said . "  Although that is not where this particular contract is headed , the fact that there is a strong Zenith presence will pay us dividends in the future . "  Zenith has been plagued by generally soft conditions in the colour television industry , reporting full-year losses since 1989 .  Last month , it reported a second-quarter loss of $ 33.2 million , or 51 cents a share , vs. a loss of $ 45.3 million , or 97 cents a share , a year earlier .  Last November , South Korea-based LG Electronics Inc. bought a majority stake in Zenith .  Robert Gutenstein , an analyst for Kalf , Voorhis & Co .  , said the contract was " not unique , but it 's big . "  " Digital is coming , it 's economic and the question is what will make the consumer happy and at what price . "  -DOCSTART-  Natural Law Party says it can meditate problems away .  WASHINGTON 1996-08-22  From the people who brought you hundreds of " yogic fliers " who claimed to defy nature by levitating comes The Natural Law Party , a minor political party that nominated a presidential candidate on Thursday .  At a hotel convention here , the party associated with the Transcendental Meditation ( TM ) movement named physicist John Hagelin as its presidential nominee for the Nov. 5 election .  The party is running on a platform claiming it can ward off problems before they occur through techniques such as mass meditation that would reduce stress , crime , terrorism and even wars .  " Social stress can be reduced and problems such as crime and violence will automatically decrease , " said a party paper .  Many party members are practitioners of TM , which involves meditating to a repeated word or phrase , called a mantra .  Some advanced TM followers contend they can actually mediate to such a point that they fly .  But in a demonstration of " yogic flying " several years ago , critics said the people were merely bouncing off the ground from a sitting position .  -DOCSTART-  Huge Windows 95 sales fail to meet expectations .  Martin Wolk  SEATTLE 1996-08-22  A year after its massively publicized introduction , Microsoft Corp. 's Windows 95 computer operating system has fallen short of the most optimistic expectations for the software giant and the industry .  Even though more than 40 million copies of Windows 95 have been sold , making it the fastest-selling new software ever , it would have been impossible for any product to live up to the unprecedented hype of the Aug. 24 , 1995 launch , when stores around the world opened at midnight to greet long lines of customers .  The Redmond , Wash.-based company spent tens of millions of dollars promoting the product with stunts that included buying the entire print run of the Times of London and lighting New York 's Empire State building in a Windows color scheme .  But the product , delivered eight months late , has fallen short of its sales potential in part because Microsoft delivered a mixed message to business customers , analysts said .  " It did n't do as well as it could have , " said Rob Enderle , an analyst with Giga Information Group .  Scores of software and hardware companies that had hoped for a big boost in sales were disappointed when only a brief spike materialized .  " People who were expecting major coat-tails were somewhat disappointed , " said Scott Winkler , an analyst with Gartner Group .  " It 's not as though it has n't had an impact , " he said . "  It just has n't had the huge earth-shattering impact some people were looking for . "  Symantec Corp. , which had been among the most bullish of software companies at the time of the Windows 95 launch , ended up posting disappointing financial results when retail sales of the operating system fell short of its projections .  Touchstone Software Corp. had to pay $ 1.3 million in cash and stock to settle a shareholders lawsuit brought after the company 's sales failed to meet expectations tied to the Windows 95 launch .  Many software developers apparently saw their crucial holiday season sales suffer last year because store shelves were jammed with blue-and-white boxes of Windows 95 , resulting in a shortage of space for seasonal products , said Ann Stephens , president of PC Data Inc .  To be sure , sales of Windows 95 and the accompanying Office 95 upgrade drove Microsoft sales up 46 percent last year to a record $ 8.67 billion and cemented the company 's status as the industry 's dominant company .  Microsoft executives say they are thrilled with the sales figures , and industry analysts estimate that by sometime next year , the installed base of Windows 95 will surpass that of the older version of Windows , now used on about 100 million computers worldwide .  But Enderle said the figure could have been even higher if Microsoft had done a better job of handling the huge demand for technical support from customers who were frustrated trying to install the system .  He and other analysts said corporate America adopted a go-slow approach because Microsoft already was promoting the new version of its high-end Windows NT operating system , expected to be available in stores in the next several weeks .  " Microsoft sent a lot of signals that NT was going to be the answer , " Winkler said . "  Many people began to believe that Windows 95 was being downplayed . "  But now that Windows NT 4.0 has been launched , Winkler and others believe only a relatively small proportion of corporate users will elect to pay the added software and hardware costs needed to use it instead of Windows 95 .  " Windows 95 is going to do great , " he said . "  The mistake people made was in thinking it was going to be a fast , sweeping change rather than a slow , building change .

WASHINGTON 1996-08-22  The United States said on Thursday it remained committed to migration accords with Cuba and would continue to repatriate intercepted Cuban migrants who attempted to enter U.S. territory illegally .  A State Department statement appeared in part a response to Cuban complaints that Washington was jeopardising the accords by failing to return some of the Cubans involved in recent illegal migration incidents .  " The United States reiterates its full commitment to the implementation " of the accords signed by the two countries in 1994 and 1995 , said the statement by spokesman Glyn Davies .  " The United States will continue to return Cuban migrants intercepted at sea who seek to enter the United States or the Guantanamo Naval Base illegally , " it said .  Washington would also take " prompt and effective law enforcement action " against alien smuggling and hijackings from Cuba , it added .  Davies told reporters the statement would be distributed in the Cuban exile community in Miami " to remind everyone of the importance of abiding by the accords and avoiding dangerous attempts to cross the straits " from Cuba to Florida .  Havana 's complaints centred on an incident in which a boatload of emigrants capsized in the Florida Straits last week and two recent aircraft hijackings from Cuba .  Sixteen of those picked up from the boat were returned to Cuba but eight were taken to the United States and three to Guantanamo Bay , a U.S. base on Cuba , until they emigrated to another nation .  The most recent hijacking , last Friday , involved three hijackers and the pilot of a small aircraft .  Davies said on Tuesday the pilot could soon return to Cuba but U.S. authorities planned to try the hijackers .  In an incident on July 7 , a Cuban interior ministry official hijacked a commercial plane and sought aylum at Guantanamo Bay .  Davies said he knew of no plans to return the man to Cuba .  -DOCSTART-  Wis .  says is first state to apply for new welfare .

According to a new release from the governor , Wisconsin submitted a plan to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for administration of the new block grant system for welfare just minutes after President Bill Clinton signed the measure into law Thursday .

Still , the governor said the new law does not go as far as the state 's own welfare reform program , dubbed W-2 .  He said that despite the new law , Wisconsin will still require federal waivers allowing the working poor to acquire health care coverage from the state , a 60-day residency requirement for participation in the welfare program , and child support collections to go directly to custodial parents .  The nation 's new welfare reform law limits eligibility , gives states more power and ends direct federal aid for poor children .  -- Karen Pierog , 312-408-8647  -DOCSTART-  Snoozing Vietnamese man takes slow train to Alaska .

Both churches were in the Mississippi delta region of Arkansas , about 90 miles ( 145 kms ) southeast of Little Rock , and were located within three miles of one another .  " We 're investigating with the idea that both fires may be arson , but that has n't been conclusively established , " said Wayne Jordan , a spokesman for the Arkansas State Police .  Agents of the F.B.I. and the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms were also at the scene , Jordan said .  Mount Zion Missionary Baptist Church and St. Matthews Missionary Baptist Church were both frame structures , each near Turner , Arkansas , a small community surrounded by cotton and soybean fields .  " This is rural Arkansas .  I 'm surprised anyone could even find us out here , " said Fannie Johnson , a member of St. Matthew 's , who said she believed arson was to blame .

LONDON 1996-08-22  U.S. marine biologists have trained a pair of sea lions to tag and photograph elusive whales as they cruise through the Pacific depths , New Scientist magazine reported on Thursday .  James Harvey and Jennifer Hurley of the Moss Landing Marine Laboratories in California say their sea lions , natural companions of many species of whale , can go where no man or woman has ever gone before .  " Any diver knows that when a whale gets going you ca n't keep up , " Harvey told the magazine . "  That is why we know only about five percent of what whales do . "  The sea lions -- 17-year-old Beaver and nine-year-old Sake -- have undergone six years of training for their mission .  Beaver once worked for the U.S. Navy and Sake is an amusement park veteran .  Harvey said they could accurately tag whales with a radio transmitter , and could also swim all the way around one of the giant mammals , filming it with a video camera .  Their first assignment , later this year , will be documenting humpback whale migration off Monterey , California .  The article did not spell out exactly how the sea lions manage to tag the whales but said in training they were taught to stick a radio transmitter on to a plastic model of a whale using suction cups .  -DOCSTART-  RTRS - Australia Senate jeopardises rate cut - Howard .  CANBERRA 1996-08-23  Australian Prime Minister John Howard said the possibility of lower interest rates was being jeopardised by Parliament 's upper house where opposition parties planned to scrutinise the 1996/97 budget .  " Every time the Senate hacks away at the budget , they hack away at the lower interest rate environment , " Howard told reporters on Thursday night after attending a Liberal Party function .  Senior ministers have repeatedly warned since the fiscally-tight budget was handed down on Tuesday night that the chance of lower official rates could be hampered in the Senate .  The budget contained sharp spending cuts in areas such as the labour market to reduce the deficit to about A$ 5.6 billion .

Lynne O'Donnell  HONG KONG 1996-08-23  Up to 100,000 tonnes of copper held in Shanghai bonded warehouses , confounding the world market as to its source and ultimate fate , probably belongs to China 's strategic state reserve , industry sources said on Friday .  Around 40,000 tonnes of the copper have already been moved to warehouses near the northern port of Yingkou , where some of the strategic stockpile was stored , they said .  Just who owns the copper is a question that has kept traders and industry analysts guessing since the metal was channelled into Shanghai by the China National Nonferrous Metals Import and Export Corp ( CNIEC ) in June and July .  It was unclear whether or not the 40,000 tonnes had cleared customs -- which would provide some concrete indication that the strategic reserve , administered directly by the central government 's State Planning Commission , owned the copper .  Traders have said the reserve could negotiate concessions on duties -- three percent import tax and 17 percent value-added tax -- that made the copper prohibitively expensive otherwise .  But one source , the head of a Hong Kong trading house , said it made no difference if the copper was customs cleared or not .  " If they spend all this money moving the copper to Yingkou , it will be sitting there for years , " he said .  " Once it arrives in Yingkou , it is subject to monitoring by the State Planning Commission , which has to give permission for any more movement ; it is out of the hands of traders , " he said .  Mystery has surrounded the Shanghai stockpile in recent months , with traders unsure not only of who owns it , but of its exact size and what its owner planned to do with it .  Trading sources generally agreed it would be cost-effective to take the copper back into a depleted central reserve as it had already served its purpose in taking advantage of long-term backwardation on the London Metal Exchange ( LME ) .  A backwardation occurs when the spot price of a metal is higher than the forward price .  CNIEC lent around 85,000 tonnes of copper onto the LME between April and June 1995 on behalf of the state reserve , running the state stockpile down to 115,000 tonnes from 200,000 tonnes previously .  Traders in Asia said CNIEC could well have lent it to the market at around US$ 2,700 a tonne , and then paid somewhere between $ 2,200 and $ 2,400 a tonne when it started taking the metal back earlier this year .  This would have cleared CNIEC a healthy profit , which could then have been used to finance storage and other costs .  Word that CNIEC had offered the copper to European trading houses in a series of secret meetings unnerved an already jittery market .  Industry analysts Bloomsbury Minerals Economics ( BME ) said on Wednesday the motivation of the owners of the 85,000 tonnes , " whoever they are , is the most important short-term fundamental " in an already tight world market .  BME repeated in its latest review rumours of involvement by Sumitomo Corp , with CNIEC said to be helping the Japanese trader unload its copper positions after it revealed in June losses of $ 1.8 billion in a decade of unauthorised deals .  Sumitomo and CNIEC have made no comments on the talk and Chinese traders said they know nothing of such an arrangement .  Traders in Shanghai said on Thursday they were unaware of movements out of the Shanghai bonded warehouses .  They reported more arrivals that were probably spot purchases .  They also expressed concern that the tonnage in bonded warehouses would move onto the domestic market .  But these concerns were irrelevant , a Singapore trader said , despite a forecast that domestic Chinese copper demand could hit one million tonnes this year .  As with many commodities , " there is a desire ( by the Chinese government ) to keep a stockpile of the metal , " he said . "  You do n't keep it to help industry , you keep it in case of emergency .

Williams seized two wickets in two deliveries and left-armer Ilott also captured two as Gloucestershire , 252 behind on first innings , slumped to 27 for four at the close on the third day of the four-day game at Colchester .  Essex , who started the current round of matches in fifth place 20 points behind leaders Derbyshire with a game in hand , could go top if they complete victory on Monday 's last day and other results favour them .  Williams thrust Essex on course for success by dispatching Matt Windows and Andrew Symonds in his second over , before Ilott removed Dominic Hewson and Tim Hancock to reduce Gloucestershire to 17 for four at one stage .

Surrey slipped to 88 for four in reply to Notts ' commanding first innings of 446 for nine declared at Trent Bridge , before Alistair Brown struck a 55-ball half-century .

LONDON 1996-08-24  Newcastle 's early season teething problems continued on Saturday when they lost 2-1 at home to premier league pacesetters Sheffield Wednesday .  England striker Alan Shearer gave Kevin Keegan 's talent-laden side the lead from the penalty spot after 13 minutes after Wednesday 's Yugoslav Dejan Stefanovic pulled down Colombian forward Faustino Asprilla .  But two minutes later Wednesday equalised through Peter Atherton , who found space in the penalty area to meet Mark Pembridge 's free kick with a precise glancing header .  Guy Whittingham stole three points for the Yorkshire side with a goal 10 minutes from time .  To add to Newcastle 's misery , England striker Les Ferdinand was stretchered off in the second half .  Wednesday , who escaped relegation on the final day of last season , have now won their first three games of the season .  Elsewhere , title hopefuls Liverpool were held 0-0 at home by newly-promoted Sunderland , and in London , the tie between Tottenham Hotspur and Everton also ended goaless .  Frenchman Frank LeBoeuf and Italian Gianluca Vialli scored their first premier league goals as Chelsea beat Coventry 2-0 , and managerless Arsenal won by the same scoreline at Leicester .

The win gave the All Blacks an unbeatable 2-0 lead in the three-test series .  Each side scored three tries and the Springboks outscored the All Blacks 15-12 in the second half but still suffered a fourth successive defeat against their old enemies .  Two tries from wing Jeff Wilson in the first quarter gave New Zealand a 24-11 lead before tries from flanker Ruben Kruger and scrum-half Joost van der Westhuizen in the space of two minutes narrowed the gap to a single point at 23-24 .  The Springboks would have gone ahead had not fly-half Joel Stransky 's conversion hit an upright and New Zealand only scrambled to safety through a fine penalty from replacement fly-half Jon Preston and a drop goal by number eight Zinzan Brooke .  -DOCSTART-  RUGBY UNION - NEW ZEALAND DEFEAT SOUTH AFRICA 33-26 .

AMSTERDAM 1996-08-24  Dutch champions Ajax Amsterdam faltered in their second league match of the season on Saturday losing 2-0 away at Heerenveen .  Ajax , who had a dismal series of pre-season results before beating NAC of Breda in their opening game , had the best of an entertaining first half but failed to break the deadlock .  Eight minutes after the interval , Heerenveen 's Romeo Wouden broke through the Amsterdam defence , left defender John Veldman standing and curled the ball beyond goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar into the Ajax net .  Ajax , without injured defenders Marcio Santos and Winston Bogarde and strikers Jari Litmanen and Marc Overmars , then stepped up the pace and looked certain to equalise .  But they left gaps at the back and on 73 minutes Danish striker Jon Dahl Tomasson rushed out of his own half , beat the Ajax defence and lobbed van der Sar .  The defeat means Ajax 's main title contenders PSV Eindhoven , who beat the champions 3-0 in the traditional league curtain-raiser , can go three points clear of their rivals if they beat Groningen on Sunday .  -DOCSTART-  SOCCER - BELGIAN FIRST DIVISION RESULTS .
